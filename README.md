# UPFRONT

UPFRONT is a Single-Page Application that allows users to create, view, edit and delete items (or tasks) in a to-do list format. 

UPFRONT utilizes a Ruby on Rails backend and a JavaScript frontend.

# Installation

1. Download the repository from https://github.com/am20dipi/upfront-task-2. 
2. Install gems with bundler.
3. Run rails db:migrate in the terminal (if necessary).
4. While in the backend directory, run command 'rails s' to run the server. 
5. Switch into the frontend directory and run 'open index.html' to open the browser view. 

# Usage

After opening the browser, type a task in the input task bar. Click 'Create Task' button to add the task to the browser page. The prompt will then make available both 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons for each task created. A user has an option to "filter" tasks by their status: 'completed', 'active' or 'all'. A user has the option to check off tasks, as well.
