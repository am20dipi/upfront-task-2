PROJECT NOTES
1. JSON
    -  
2. HOISTING
    - invoking a variable before it is declared
    - JS reads the file twice, that is why we can do this. 
    - "var" gets hoisted
    - ** Function declarations can be hoisted ONLY. (the whole function block)
3. ARROW FUNCTIONS
    - 
4. ES6
     - ECMASCRIPT
     - changes & updates to JS
     - ES6 version includes:
        - class notation, arrow functions, const & let, spread operator, destructuring, rest operator
5. "THIS" KEYWORD
    - refers to the current object
    - changes based on the context
    - Think: "self"
6. REST / SPREAD OPERATOR
    - 
7. FETCH
    - returns the Promise Object
    - takes in an endpoint as an argument
    - both GET and POST
    - request to retrieve / send data
8. PROMISES
    - Promise Object will return (3) statuses: Fulfilled, Pending or Denied.
    - Promise Object responds to (3) instance methods: .then(), .catch(), & .finally()
    - .catch() handles errors
9. EVENT LISTENERS
    - (1) listens for a specific event
    - (2) calls on a callback function when an event occurs
10. OBJECT.ASSIGN()
    - 
11. CLOSURE
    -
12. SERIALIZERS
     - serializing: modifying what data(such as specific attributes) is allowed/to show
     - serializer classes respond to model associations!
13. RACK / CORS
    - allows us to fire requests from the frontend
    - middleware
    - cross origin reference sharing (CORS)
    - stored in config/initializers/cors.rb
    - RACK-CORS is a gem
    - allows us to protect our application from requests we do not want to accept
14. API
     - Application Program Interface
     - exposes data to the public via requests
15. SCAFFOLD
     - generator used for backend
     - creates table, model class, resources, routes, controller, etc.
16. CALLBACK FUNCTIONS
17. FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS
18. DESTRUCTURING
    - allows us to quickly map variables to a collection of data
    - 
19. CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS
20. event.target
    - will always return the element that triggered the event
